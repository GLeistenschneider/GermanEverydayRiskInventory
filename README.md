# TheGermanEverydayRiskInventory
R Scripts to analyse and make the German Risk Inventory (GERI) for my Bachelor Thesis

This project contains the analysis and secrets to make the GERI. 
The GERI contains 49 reliable situations, which reflect everyday risk scenarios. It shall be used for 
future risk research as a out of the lab 'ish' approach to finding out more about risk behavior. Since 
this is my biggest R project so far, be advised. Some of it may seem like non-sense and it even may 
be non-sense. But it all works if you just stick to the comments. If not, do not hesitate to contact 
me!

riskie.R -> contains analysis of the rated situations and the creation of the GERI
